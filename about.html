    <hr>
    <p>“I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to
        do my best. On a daily basis I challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to
        do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and
        graphics..”</p>
    <p> “I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to
        strive towards. I am not comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and
        achieve greatness.”</p>
    <p>“I am highly organised. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines.
        I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I am always able to find what I need. I
        find this increases efficiency and also helps the rest of the team stay on track. This increases my overall producivity”</p>
    <p>“I am a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can
        almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I
        find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off new projects with wonderful team-mates.”</p>
