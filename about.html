    <hr>
    <p>“I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to
        do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to
        do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and
        graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.”</p>
    <p> “I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to
        strive towards. I am not comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and
        achieve greatness. In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years.”</p>
    <p>“I am highly organised. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines.
        I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I am always able to find what I need. I
        find this increases efficiency and also helps the rest of the team stay on track. In my last role, I created a
        new filing process that increased departmental efficiency by 25 percent.”</p>
    <p>“I am a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can
        almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I
        find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with new clients. In my previous job, my
        clients’ customer satisfaction scores were 15 percent over the company average.”</p>
